h1. Behave

A standard pattern to easily define and add behavior to a global behavior repository. This pattern contains a macro that makes it easier to add such behaviors to 
Ruby classes of your choice. The Behave pattern will be demonstrated by the _troles_ gems for adding role behavior.
Behave also makes it easy to support multiple kinds of datastores via the _schemaker_ gem, that takes care of configuring your model relationships.  

h2. Usage

The idea is that you should be able to apply the behave pattern on a class:

This will add a #behavior collection at the class level, where each item is a Behave::Decorator instance. 
Each such Behave::Decorator instance has a Behave::Configuration object that configures it.

The Behave::Configuration encapsulates concepts such as storage, strategy etc. and can do schema/model configuration (using schemaker) etc.

<pre>
class User  
  behavior(:trole_groups).configure(:strategy) :ref_one do |strategy|
    strategy.orm = :mongoid
    strategy.auto_load = true
  end.configure!
end  
</pre>

See the code for more details for now. This is currently work in progress...

h2. Contributing to behave
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
